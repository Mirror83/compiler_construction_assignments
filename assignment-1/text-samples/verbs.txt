Lisa was sitting by the window, lost in thought. .

"What am I doing with my life?" she wondered.

She had been working tirelessly, but the results were yet to be seen.

"People are often blinded by what they think they should do", she thought.

She realized she could be doing something more fulfilling.
When she had been younger, her dreams were vivid and endless. 
But time had a way of being unkind to dreams.

"Will I ever find my true path?" she asked herself.

She decided she would go wherever her passion leads, no longer being confined by the mundane. 
And so, her journey began, full of hope and uncertainty. 

And a red hibiscus in hand.
